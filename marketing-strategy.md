# Marketing Strategy for My Wedding Dress

## 1. Social Media (Priority: HIGH)

### TikTok & Instagram Reels

- Partner with [wedding content creators](https://creators.feedspot.com/wedding_tiktok_influencers/) like @gowneyedgirl (1.2M followers) who reviews wedding dresses
- Encourage users to share their virtual try-on results with a branded hashtag (#MyWeddingDressAI)
- Nearly half of engaged couples use video content for wedding inspiration

### Influencer Strategy

- Offer free credits in exchange for honest reviews and try-on videos
- Target recently engaged influencers for authentic content

## 8. Top Video Formats for TikTok/Reels

### 1. POV (Point of View) — Most Viral Potential
**Format:** Text overlay + relatable scenario
**Example:**
> "POV: You found an app that lets you try on 500+ wedding dresses from your couch"
>
> *[Shows model scrolling through app, tapping dresses, seeing herself in different gowns]*

**Why it works:**
- Instantly relatable to engaged women
- Text hook grabs attention in first 0.5 seconds
- Low production effort, high engagement

**Script template:**
```
POV: [relatable bride scenario]
- "POV: Your fiancé doesn't want to go dress shopping with you"
- "POV: The bridal shop only had 3 dresses in your size"
- "POV: You're an introvert who hates being watched while trying on clothes"
```

---

### 2. Transformation (Before/After) — Highest Save Rate
**Format:** Casual outfit → hand/flower covers camera → reveal in wedding dress
**Example:**
> *[Girl in pajamas spinning]*
> *[Hand covers camera]*
> *[Same girl now in stunning ball gown]*

**Why it works:**
- Satisfying visual payoff
- Showcases the core app feature (virtual try-on)
- High rewatch and share rate

**Transition triggers:**
- Hand covering camera
- Flower/bouquet blocking lens
- Spinning with fabric flowing
- Walking toward camera until blur

---

### 3. "I Tried X Dresses" / GRWM Style — Best for Longer Watch Time
**Format:** Screen recording or talking head showing multiple try-ons
**Example:**
> "I tried on 10 wedding dresses in 60 seconds using AI"
>
> *[Quick cuts showing different dress styles on same person]*

**Why it works:**
- Educational + entertaining
- Shows app variety (silhouettes, styles)
- Longer watch time = algorithm boost

**Variations:**
- "Ranking wedding dress styles on my body type"
- "Which Disney princess dress suits me best?"
- "A-line vs Mermaid vs Ball Gown on ME"
